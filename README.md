### Hi there 👋

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about seeking the meaning of life, the universe, and everything (42) with a beer (🍺). I’m currently:

- Working with development (Java, Python and PHP) and project monitoring using agile techniques (2010);
- Graduated in Computer Science (2013);
- Graduated in Java technology specialist (2016);
- Scrum certification by EXIN Agile Scrum Foundation (2019);
- Tech lead of Centro de Tecnologias Abertas e IoT at PTI (2020-Present).
