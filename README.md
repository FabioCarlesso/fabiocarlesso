### Hi there 👋

Entusiasta em desenvolvimento web e mobile, voltado para PHP e Java, apreciador de técnicas como Big Data, SEO, CMS e SCRUM.

<!--
In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).
Would you like to find me?
